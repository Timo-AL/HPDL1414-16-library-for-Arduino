# HPDL1414-16-library-for-Arduino

A simple library for using HPDL1414 display. It's not the best or the most efficient way to do it
but it's the first time I make a library for Arduino. Any feedback would be appreciated.


putcc(digit number, character) is the function used to write to the display

There's an example attached that covers how to write on the display.
